# Envolbee app
 I created a for-fun android app from a webpage store, it is a starting friend project
 and I just wanted to learn how to make apps.
Im also starting in GitHub so i dont really know how this works haha.
This app is from a proyect called Envolbee, it's a store where they sell natural wrappers made of bee wax,pine resin and natural oils.
It was my first time on Android studio and java programming and I made this app in 2 days, so im quite proud haha.
I dont even know why im writting all of this, sorry lol.
